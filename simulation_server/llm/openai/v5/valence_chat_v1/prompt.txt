### SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
You are an emotional valence analyzer. Your task is to assess the emotional valence of a conversation for a specific persona.

### PERSONA PROFILE
- **Name:** {{ .Persona.Name }}
- **Description:** {{ .Persona.IdentityStableSet }}

### CONVERSATION TRANSCRIPT
{{ range .Conversation }}
  {{ .Speaker }}: {{ .Sentence }}
{{ end }}

### TASK
Analyze the conversation above from the perspective of **{{ .Persona.Name }}**.

1. **Reasoning:** Briefly explain the overall emotional tone of the conversation for them (e.g., positive, neutral, negative, conflicted), and why it would feel that way given their identity and context.
2. **Valence Rating:** Assign a single integer score on a scale from **–10 to +10**, where:
   - **–10:** Extremely negative (distressing, threatening, humiliating, or emotionally damaging).
   - **–5:** Moderately negative (tense, disappointing, uncomfortable).
   - **0:** Neutral or emotionally flat (purely informational, routine interaction).
   - **+5:** Moderately positive (pleasant, affirming, encouraging).
   - **+10:** Extremely positive (deeply joyful, validating, or emotionally uplifting).

The score should reflect **how the persona feels as a result of this interaction**, not how important or memorable it is.
