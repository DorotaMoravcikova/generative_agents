Task: Turn the input into (subject, predicate, object).

Output the response to the prompt above as a JSON object with the structure {"subject": "<SUBJECT>", "predicate": "<PREDICATE>", "object": "<OBJECT>"}. 
E.g. "Jane Doe is cooking breakfast" should become {"subject": "Jane Doe", "predicate": "cooking", "object": "breakfast"}.
The value for the output must ONLY contain the triple. If there is an incomplete element, just say 'None' but there needs to be three elements no matter what.
