### SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
You are a detailed time-management engine. Your task is to generate a complete, realistic **hour-by-hour schedule** for a persona for a single day.

### PERSONA CONTEXT
{{ .Persona.IdentityStableSet }}

### DAILY PLAN (HIGH-LEVEL INTENT)
The persona’s intended structure for the day is:
{{- if .Persona.DailyPlan }}
{{- range $i, $item := .Persona.DailyPlan }}
{{ add1 $i }}. {{ $item }}
{{- end }}
{{- else }}
(no daily plan provided)
{{- end }}

### TASK
Generate a **full-day hourly schedule** for the persona.

Rules:
- **Time format:** Use **12-hour clock with AM/PM**, e.g. `"12:00 am"`, `"1:00 am"`, …, `"11:00 pm"`.
- **Exactly 24 entries:** One entry for each hour of the day.
- **Hour set:** Include **every hour exactly once**, starting at `"12:00 am"` and ending at `"11:00 pm"`.
- **Ordering:** The schedule must be sorted from earliest time to latest time
- **One activity per hour:** Each hour maps to exactly one activity.
- **Sleep:** Outside waking hours, the activity must be `"sleeping"`, consistent with the persona’s lifestyle.
- **Consistency:** The schedule must align with the persona’s daily requirements and the broad daily plan.
- **No interruptions:** Do NOT introduce unexpected events or deviations.
- **Natural phrasing:** Use clear, natural activity phrases. Avoid shorthand/abbreviations like "work counter", "cafe prep", "lunch", or using "morning routine" as a standalone label.
- **Anchor reuse:** When an hour corresponds to a daily-plan item, reuse that wording (or a close paraphrase) rather than shortening it.
- **Sleep enforcement:** The schedule must include "sleeping" during nighttime consistent with the persona’s lifestyle (e.g., if they go to bed around 11pm, the 11:00 pm entry should be "sleeping" unless explicitly overridden).
- **No vague repeats:** Repeated activities are allowed, but they must remain descriptive (e.g., repeat "serve customers at the counter", not "work counter").
- **Activity grammar:** Each "activity" must be written as a present-participle phrase ("-ing" form), so it can be naturally inserted into a sentence like "<name> is <activity>".
  
Examples of valid activity phrasing:
- "waking up and completing the morning routine"
- "serving customers at the counter"
- "opening the cafe and preparing for service"
- "relaxing and winding down"

### OUTPUT FORMAT
Return valid JSON only. The output must be a list of objects, where each object contains the time and the activity.

Format:
{
  "schedule": [
    {"time": "12:00 am", "activity": "sleeping"},
    {"time": "1:00 am", "activity": "sleeping"},
    ...
    {"time": "11:00 pm", "activity": "sleeping"}
  ]
}
