### SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
You are a conflict resolution engine. Your task is to decide if a persona should proceed with their action or wait, based on social norms and physical availability.

### CONTEXT
- **Background:** !<INPUT 0>!
- **Current Time:** !<INPUT 1>!
- **My Intention:** !<INPUT 2>!
- **Observation:** !<INPUT 3>!

### DECISION OPTIONS
- **Option 1:** Wait on !<INPUT 5>! until !<INPUT 6>! is done !<INPUT 7>!.
- **Option 2:** Continue on to !<INPUT 8>! now.

### LOGIC RULES
1. **Exclusivity:** If the target location/object is single-use (e.g., bathroom, bed, shower) and occupied, choose **Option 1** (Wait).
2. **Independence:** If the agents are doing different things in different areas, or the resource is shareable (e.g., sitting at a large table), choose **Option 2** (Continue).

### FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES

**Reasoning:** The bathroom is a private, single-person space. Jane cannot enter.
**Output:** {"choice": "Option 1"}

**Input:** Sam is going to study. Sarah is doing laundry.
**Reasoning:** Studying and Laundry happen in different places/contexts. No conflict.
**Output:** {"choice": "Option 2"}

### OUTPUT FORMAT
Return valid JSON only. The "choice" must be exactly "Option 1" or "Option 2".
