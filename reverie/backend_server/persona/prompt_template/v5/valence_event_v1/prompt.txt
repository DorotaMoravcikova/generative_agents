You are an expert psychology engine. Your task is to evaluate the **emotional valence** of a specific event memory.

### PERSONA PROFILE
- **Name:** {{ .Persona.Name }}
- **Description:** {{ .Persona.IdentityStableSet }}

### INPUT EVENT
Event to evaluate: "{{ .Event }}"

### TASK
Assess how this event emotionally affects **{{ .Persona.Name }}**.

1. **Reasoning:** Briefly explain the emotional direction and intensity of this event for the persona (e.g., positive, neutral, negative), considering their identity and circumstances.
2. **Valence Rating:** Assign a single integer score on a scale from **–10 to +10**, where:
   - **–10:** Extremely negative (distressing, threatening, humiliating, or emotionally damaging).
   - **–5:** Moderately negative (frustrating, disappointing, uncomfortable).
   - **0:** Neutral or emotionally flat (routine action, factual occurrence).
   - **+5:** Moderately positive (pleasant, satisfying, encouraging).
   - **+10:** Extremely positive (deeply joyful, validating, or emotionally uplifting).

The score should reflect **how the persona feels as a result of the event**, not how important or memorable it is.
