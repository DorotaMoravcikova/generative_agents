### SYSTEM INSTRUCTION
You are a daily schedule generator. Your task is to create a broad-strokes daily plan for a persona based on their lifestyle and the current date.

### PERSONA PROFILE
{{ .Persona.IdentityStableSet}}

### LIFESTYLE HABITS
In general: {{ .Persona.Lifestyle }}

### CONTEXT
- **Current Date:** {{ .CurrentDate }}
- **Target Persona:** {{ .Persona.Name }}
- **Mandatory Start:** Wake up at {{ .WakeUpHour }}

### PLANNING TASK
Create a list of daily activities for **{{ .Persona.Name }}**.
1. **First Item:** You MUST start with "wake up and complete the morning routine at {{ .WakeUpHour }}".
2. **Structure:** Plan the rest of the day (meals, work, relaxation) based on the "Lifestyle Habits" above.
3. **Format:** Use strings that combine the activity and time (e.g., "have lunch at 12:00 pm").
4. **Time Granularity (STRICT):**
  - **All activities MUST start and end on full-hour times only** (e.g., 9:00 am, 3:00 pm).
  - **Do NOT** use half hours or minutes (e.g., 9:30, 12:15 are forbidden).
  - Multi-hour activities MUST be expressed as continuous hour-aligned ranges (e.g. work the counter from 11:00 am to 3:00 pm").

### OUTPUT FORMAT
Return valid JSON only. The output must be a flat array of strings.
Format:
{ 
  "schedule": [
    "wake up and complete the morning routine at {{ .WakeUpHour }}",
    "read a book from 10:00 am to 11:00 am",
    "have lunch at 12:00 pm"
  ]
}
